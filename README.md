# **Projects**
## **Excel-to-vCard**
Project Overview: Developed a tool that converts contact information from Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) into vCard (.vcf) format, enabling seamless import of contacts into iPhone devices. This tool simplifies the process of transferring bulk contact data without manual input.

### Technical Highlights
- Utilized Python and openpyxl for data extraction and manipulation from .xlsx files.
- Used vobject library for generating .vcf (vCard) files.
- Implemented error handling to ensure valid data formatting for contact fields (e.g., names, phone numbers, emails).
- Supported batch processing of multiple contacts at once, optimizing time for large data imports.


### Impact
- Reduced manual contact entry by automating the conversion process.
- Enhanced productivity for users by enabling bulk contact imports in seconds.
- Improved data accuracy and reduced formatting errors during contact transfers to iPhones.

## **Green Commute Optimizer**
Project Overview: Our route planner offers a unique solution by providing users with multiple route options—shortest, second shortest, balanced, and most convenient—based on carbon emissions, distance, and convenience for MRT and bus networks. Unlike Google Maps, which primarily focuses on convenience or time, our application emphasizes eco-friendly travel. By helping users choose routes that minimize their carbon footprint, it supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of promoting sustainable transport.

### Technical Highlights
- Implemented Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for efficient pathfinding on public transport routes.
- Utilised Yen's K-Shortest Path algorithm to generate multiple alternative routes, offering users more flexibility in case of disruptions.
- Employed Python for backend development and Vue.js with the Quasar framework for a responsive frontend interface.
- Scraped and cleaned real-time data from LTA, TransitLink, and integrated OneMap API for accurate route distances and carbon emission calculation


### Impact
- Empowered users to reduce carbon emissions by selecting eco-friendly transport routes.
- Provided time savings in route planning by offering flexible route alternatives.
- Enhanced Singapore’s sustainability efforts by promoting environmentally conscious travel decisions.
